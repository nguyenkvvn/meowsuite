# meowtag
Meowtag is a small applet that implements taglib-sharp to merge in user-populated metadata from a meowsplit output

## Usage

`meowtag <path_to_csv>`

Meowtag is very simple to use- point it to the CSV containing the populated information generated by `meowsplit`, and it will populate the respective .mp3 file ID tags, provided the .mp3 files are in the working directory with the respective file names.

## How to build

Build using Visual Studio 2017, targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2. The NuGet package manager should automatically fetch the `taglib` library.
